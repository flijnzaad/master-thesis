% Why are reasoning and communication special?

Two cognitive skills that are often considered\todo{source?} to set humans apart from their evolutionarily closest relatives are on the one hand our outstanding capacity for reasoning, and on the other our profound communicative abilities.
% in what way is our reasoning superior?
Our ability to reason symbolically on the one hand
and
% in what way is our communication superior?
our languages with complex syntax, semantics and pragmatics on the other hand, are unmatched in the animal kingdom.

% Why are reasoning and communication intertwined?
It is hard to imagine our communication without reasoning. In our everyday lives, a lot of the content we intend to convey to others, we relay pragmatically\todo{source?}: we do not literally spell out these things, but rather hope and expect our interlocutors to infer the intended message from the communicated content.
% example
When I ask my dinner partner if they can pass me the salt, they infer that I am not interested in learning about their ability to pass me the salt but rather that I am requesting to be passed the salt.
% another example

% Why might reasoning and communication be evolutionarily causally related?
It is thus easy to see that reasoning and communication are in a way intertwined. But what is the extent and nature of this relation?
% explain about MS11
In \citeyear{MS11}, Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber proposed a revolutionary\todo{can I say that?} theory of reasoning that intended to account for a number of issues in the experimental psychology of reasoning.
According to their \emph{argumentative theory of reasoning}, the main function of reasoning in humans is argumentative; that is, reasoning evolved in humans in order to devise arguments and evaluate those of others. This theory is able to explain a number of properties of human reasoning, such as confirmation bias, and the phenomenon of motivated reasoning leading to attitude polarization.

In the words of Mercier and Sperber,
% argument your way to the research question
\begin{quote}
    Reasoning has evolved and persisted mainly because it makes human communication more effective and advantageous.
    \citep[p.~60]{MS11}
\end{quote}

% The research question

This thesis intends to scrutinize this position, and take it further, to ultimately
answer the question of whether advanced reasoning skills in humans evolved because they facilitate more advanced communication.

In order to answer this research question, I will at length consider the argumentative theory of Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber \citep{MS11, Mercier16, MS17}. Then, an exploration of the origins of human communication is in order \citep{Tomasello08-origins, Moore17, Scott-Phillips17-pragmatics, Scott-Phillips18-communication, Benitez21}.
