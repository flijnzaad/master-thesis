\chapter{The argumentative theory of reasoning closely inspected}
\label{ch:scrutiny}

Although Mercier \& Sperber's story about the evolution and function of reasoning is quite convincing on the face of it, their theory seems to leave a number of details underexposed. Moreover, the argumentative theory of reasoning makes a number of assumptions that are in need of explication and detailed discussion.

In this chapter, I will scrutinize a number of assumptions of the argumentative theory of reasoning (ATR) and make explicit some details that require spelling out.

\section{What is reasoning? Revisited}
\label{sec:def-scrutiny}

However, much more remains to be said about this very definition. Let us first briefly consider other definitions of reasoning from the literature, and then place some question marks around the position of Mercier \& Sperber's definition of reasoning within their argumentative theory.

\subsection{Other definitions of reasoning}

        \item Explicate \poscite{Harman86} definition

        \item Compare these definitions to that of \citet{MS11}
    \end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Accusations of circularity}

\thinkL{It's not really a circularity but more that the evolutionary claim is void if reasoning equals arugmentation. Work this out}

The definition of reasoning given and used by Mercier \& Sperber is reminiscent of definitions of argumentation, in particular in its use of the terms 'premise' and 'conclusion'. In a \citeyear{Sperber01} paper, which can be considered to be a precursory work to \citet{MS11}, Dan Sperber uses the following definition of argumentation:
\begin{quoting}
    the defense of some conclusion by appeal to a set of premises that provide support for it
    \hfill (p.~401)
\end{quoting}
and somewhat less precisely, \citet{MS11} define arguments as
\begin{quoting}
    representations of relationships between premises and conclusions
    \hfill (p.~58)
\end{quoting}

Comparing these definitions of argumentation and of reasoning raises a question: what is reasoning, if not internalized argumentation? Or, in a similar vein, what is argumentation, if not externalized reasoning? And, if this is the case, does this not render the argumentative theory of reasoning circular? For then the theory would state that the main function of internalized argumentation is argumentative.

\section{Epistemic vigilance, revisited}
\label{sec:EV-scrutiny}

It seems that the argumentative theory of reasoning rests on the notion of epistemic vigilance and its mechanisms having evolved in humans. Therefore, this concept deserves some extra attention.
In this section, I will first discuss the position of the notion of epistemic vigilance within the argumentative theory of reasoning. Then, I will discuss a critical response to \citet{Sperber10} by Kourken \citet{Michaelian13}, and in turn Dan \poscite{Sperber13} response to the criticism.

Briefly, \citet{Michaelian13} spells out some of the assumptions that he claims are inherent to the argument for epistemic vigilance. He contrasts these assumptions with evidence from deception detection research. In doing so, he maintains that epistemic vigilance does not play a major role in ensuring the stability of communication. Rather, he argues, the majortiy of the burden comes to \emph{speaker honesty}. In the same \citeyear{Sperber13} issue of \emph{Episteme}, Dan Sperber provides a response to the criticisms of Michaelian. He resolves some misunderstandings and provides further details to reemphasize his perceived importance of epistemic vigilance to the stability of communication.

\subsection{Epistemic vigilance and the ATR}
\label{sec:epi-vigil-atr}

It is clear that the notion of epistemic vigilance is important for the argumentative theory of reasoning, but it will be illuminating to consider exactly the role or position of epistemic vigilance within the ATR.

Returning to the paper coining the ATR, \citet{MS11} have the following to say about epistemic vigilance:

\begin{quoting}
    For communication to be stable, it has to benefit both senders and receivers (\ldots) To avoid being victims of misinformation, receivers must therefore exercise some degree of what may be called epistemic vigilance (Sperber et al. 2010).
\hfill (p.~60)
\end{quoting}
In other words, the stability of communication depends on its benefits for both the sender and the receiver. According to Mercier \& Sperber, the benefits for the receiver depend on, or are mediated by, epistemic vigilance.

\poscite{Sperber01} 'evolutionary arms race' is foundational to the argumentative theory of reasoning. Epistemic vigilance is one of the steps in this arms race, having evolved as a defense against misinformation and deception.What's more, epistemic vigilance is a critical component of the argumentative theory of reasoning: for, if receivers were not vigilant, senders need not have the ability to display the coherence of their arguments to be able to convince receivers.
Let us now go through the points of scrutiny that Kourken \citet{Michaelian13} subjects Sperber and colleagues' epistemic vigilance to, and consider \poscite{Sperber13} response to the scrutiny.

\subsection{Strong vs. weak readings of the argument for epistemic vigilance}

In their \citeyear{Sperber10} paper, Sperber and colleagues hint at different ways to interpret their argument:

\begin{quoting}
    It is because of the risk of deception that epistemic vigilance may be not merely advantageous but indispensable if communication itself is to remain advantageous.
\hfill (p.~360)
\end{quoting}
Sperber et al. thus seem to prefer to remain agnostic (or, put differently: vague) on the exact role of epistemic vigilance in explaining the stability of communication: is epistemic vigilance "merely advantageous", or is it "indispensable"? In other words, is it just the case that the benefits of epistemic vigilance outweigh its costs, leading to its having evolved in humans; or, stronger, would communication collapse if it were not for receivers' epistemic vigilance?
\todo[inline]{I don't know if I explained the distinction well here}

Kourken Michaelian picks up on these different positions of epistemic vigilance in his response paper \citeyear{Michaelian13}. He distinguishes between a strong and weak reading of Sperber et al.'s argument for epistemic vigilance, in line with this distinction between vigilance being indispensable or advantageous, respectively. He then argues that Sperber et al.'s argument for epistemic vigilance assumes the strong reading

In his response to Michaelian, Sperber states that “I now believe that we could and should have been even less definite” (p. 63) in recognizing a stronger and weaker reading of their argument. He argues that the acknowledgement of two readings of the argument would be a too static way to look at the situation. The degree to which vigilance is advantageous or even indispensable to a receiver, varies greatly from situation to situation, he argues:

The benefits of vigilance may be negligible in some communicative interactions and essential in other interactions. 
(63)

- [ ]  Does it matter whether epistemic vigilance is advantageous or indispensable, from an evolutionary causation point of view?
    
    I guess it being advantageous implies that its costs outweigh its benefits, right? What does it mean for vigilance to be indispensable? See above
    

For the argument that Sperber et al. put forward, it is sufficient that communication is *on average* advantageous to both parties (Sperber et al. 2010, p. 360).

\subsection{Effectiveness of epistemic vigilance}

\begin{quoting}
    People stand to gain immensely from communication with others, but this leaves them open to the risk of being accidentally or intentionally misinformed, which may reduce, cancel, or even reverse these gains.
\hfill (p.~360)
\end{quoting}

\section{How is convincing others advantageous?}

The account of human communication that underpins the argumentative theory of reasoning (see \citet{Sperber01, Sperber10})
entails that for human communication to have stabilized over time, it must have been evolutionarily advantageous to both the sender and the receiver. I agree that it is reasonable to assume that -- since it depends on the participation of two parties -- communication would collapse if either party was not experiencing any benefits from the action. Let us now briefly discuss these benefits.

The possible benefit of communication to the receiver is for them to gain information (to the extent that it is genuine information).
\todo{Does this need to be spelled out more still?}
\todo[inline]{This is not really accurate: see notes of \citet{Michaelian13}}
This benefit seems straight-forward enough: communication can enable us to gain information about the world in a similar way to how direct perception, or inference on the basis of held beliefs, yield information to us. However, we should be careful to regard communication as 'cognition by proxy', since the sender also stands to gain from communication and thus has their own interests as well \citep{Sperber01}.

On the other side of the coin, \citet{Sperber01} describes the benefits of communication to the sender as follows:
\begin{quoting}
    From the point of view of producers of messages, what makes communication, and testimony in particular, beneficial is that it allows them to have desirable effects on the receivers' attitudes and behavior. By communicating, one can cause others to do what one wants them to do and to take specific attitudes to people, objects, and so on.
    \hfill (p.~404)
\end{quoting}
The details of this point in particular require some explication in order to understand their force within the evolutionary story.

        \item Check \citet{MS11} for a possible quote on benefits of convincing others: how do they describe it there?

        \item (It might turn out that the benefits of persuasion are already discussed in Chapter 2 once it's revised.)
    \end{itemize}
}

% On the flip side of these benefits of convincing others are the purported disadvantages to the receiver that come with being deceived by the sender. \citet{Sperber10} state that
% \begin{quoting}
%     being accidentally or intentionally misinformed (\ldots) may reduce, cancel, or even reverse [the gains received from communication with others]
%     \hfill (p.~360)
% \end{quoting}

\section{The evolutionary 'arms race' between communicator and addressee}
\label{sec:arms-race}

In his discussion of the evolution of testimony and argumentation,\citet{Sperber01} sketches out the steps in what he calls the 'evaluation-persuasion arms race', i.e.\@ the chain of evolutionary adaptations that has resulted in our mechanisms for argument production and evaluation.
He argues that the first step in this arms race was for the addressee to develop coherence checking, as a defense against the risks of deception by the communicator. The second step was then for the communicator to anticipate this coherence-checking by overtly displaying the coherence of their message to their addressee, which requires argumentative form. The next steps were on the side of the addressee to develop skills for examining these displays of coherence (i.e., arguments), and on the side of the communicator to 'improve their argumentative skills'.

In this section I will work out this sketch of the evolutionary arms race in more detail. In doing so, I will supplement and possibly amend the sketch with findings from \citet{Sperber10}, \citet{MS11}, \citet{Reboul17}, and the conclusion of my discussion of \citet{Michaelian13} in \cref{sec:epi-vigil-crit}.

\todo[inline]{I believe this section will build upon multiple other sections in this chapter (criticisms of epistemic vigilance, benefits of persuasion, etc.), so I should fill it in later than the others.}
\todo[inline]{Also discuss here: how it works on evolutionary theory that senders and receivers are the same people.}

\section{Motivations and dispositions of interlocutors}

Throughout their \citeyear{MS11} article, Mercier \& Sperber allude to the dispositions\todo{'Dispositions' is not meant as a technical term, and I don't think it is; is it?}
of interlocutors in argumentative settings\footnote{Emphasis in quotes added.}:
\begin{quoting}
    This experiment illustrates the more general finding stemming from this literature that, \emph{when they are \textbf{motivated}, participants are able to use reasoning to evaluate arguments accurately}
    \hfill (p.~61)
\end{quoting}
\begin{quoting}
    Most participants are \textbf{willing} to change their mind only once they have been thoroughly convinced that their initial answer was wrong
    \hfill (p.~63)
\end{quoting}
\begin{quoting}
    this [experimental finding] should not be interpreted as revealing a lack of ability but only a lack of \textbf{motivation}. When participants \textbf{want} to prove a conclusion wrong, they will find ways to falsify it.
    \hfill (p.~65)
\end{quoting}
\begin{quoting}
    people are good at assessing arguments and are quite able to do so in an unbiased way, \textbf{provided they have no particular axe to grind}. In group reasoning experiments where participants \textbf{share an interest in discovering the right answer}, it has been shown that \emph{truth wins}
    \hfill (p.~72)
\end{quoting}
This reference to the motivations and disposition of interlocutors opens up some questions as to the specifics of the 'argumentative setting' that Mercier \& Sperber mention multiple times throughout the paper. It seems that the disposition of the interlocutors going into an argument plays an important role in Mercier \& Sperber's account of argumentation, yet they do not expand on this.
How plausible is the assumption that people engaging in argumentation have a 'common interest in the truth', as Mercier \& Sperber call it? And what happens (or what would happen) when interlocutors do \emph{not} share this interest?
