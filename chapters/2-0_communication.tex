\chapter{On communication}
\label{ch:communication}

Human communication is uniquely sophisticated and remarkably pervasive.
In this chapter, we will dive head-first into studying communication, guided by the four methodological questions expounded in \cref{sec:evo-conclusion}.
First, we will consider different conceptions and definitions of communication in \cref{sec:comm:definition}. Then we will consider how non-human animals and human children communicate, respectively, in \cref{sec:comm:phylogeny,sec:comm:ontogeny}. Lastly, we will discuss the utility of communication at length in \cref{sec:comm:function}. Within this discussion, we also consider the evolution of human cooperation, the issue of the stability of communication, and the role of deception in this.

\section{Conceptions of communication}
\label{sec:comm:definition}

There are many different ways in which organisms may communicate with each other, and indeed many different ways in which one may define communication. In any case, communication is a process necessarily involving a sender (communicator or speaker) and at least one receiver (addressee or listener). In the literature, especially that on animal communication, the terms 'communication' and 'signalling' are used interchangeably; therefore, I will consider them to be interchangeable as well.

Some authors regard communication to inherently be a tool of persuasion, which then translates to their very definition of communication: for example, on the manipulative model of communication, communication can be taken to occur
\begin{quoting}
    when an animal, the actor, does something which appears to be the result of selection to influence the sense organs of another animal, the reactor, so that the reactor's behavior changes to the advantage of the actor
    \hfill \citep[p.~283]{DawkinsKrebs78}
\end{quoting}
Here we see \citeauthor{DawkinsKrebs78} embedding a teleological explanation in their definition, when they speak of "the result of selection"; recall \cref{sec:teleology}.
But more pressingly, they also include the aspect of benefits to the sender and thus some stance on the function of communication in it ("to the advantage of the [sender]").
Because of this, I believe this definition to be insufficiently parsimonious in its assumptions. So let us instead turn to some conceptions of communication that are more neutral with regards to how communication may be used.

In their discussion of communication as it relates to social cognition, \citet{Freeberg19} define communication as follows:
\begin{quoting}
    Communication involves an action or characteristic of one individual that influences the behaviour, behavioural tendency or physiology of at least one other individual in a fashion typically adaptive to both
    \hfill (p.~281)
\end{quoting}
This is a very broad conception of communication, and it encompasses more cases than \citeauthor{DawkinsKrebs78}'s definition. It not only covers our case at hand -- humans speaking and listening to each other -- but also for example bacteria communicating population density through chemical signals \citep{Federle03}, squirrels producing alarm calls to alert their relatives of danger \citep{Sherman77}, plants communicating distress through airborne sounds \citep{Khait23}, and many more such cases.
% One case we in particular is that of the peacock's tail --- a characteristic of the peacock that influences the behavior of other individuals, in the sense that it makes him more sexually attractive to peahens. We return to this example in \cref{sec:S-P08}.

\citet{Scott-Phillips15-primate} contrasts two different models of communication with each other: the classical \emph{code model} of communication, and the \emph{ostensive-inferential} model of communication.
In the former model, communication involves processes of coding and decoding messages. The coding, on the side of the sender, involves a mapping between the state of the world and a behavior, the behavior being the signal they send. Then decoding, on the side of the receiver, involves a mapping between two behaviors: the signal sent by the sender, and the subsequent response of the receiver. If the mappings are properly calibrated to each other, communication between sender and receiver can be said to have occurred.

However, in order to capture human communication, the code model is too simplistic, because it fails to account for the \emph{underdeterminacy of meaning}: merely taking the message at surface value, one cannot account for the meaning\footnote{I use the intuitive, colloquial interpretation of the term 'meaning', as I consider further explorations into the philosophy of language out of scope for this thesis.} that the message conveys to the sender (\citet{Scott-Phillips18-communication}; consider also \citet{Quine60}'s views on radical translation).
Therefore, a move away from the code model of communication towards the \emph{ostensive-inferential} model of communication would be in order. This model, introduced by \citet{SperberWilson86} as part of their neo-Gricean framework of relevance theory, takes into account the intentionality inherent in human communication.

In the ostensive-inferential model, one may speak of a sender's \emph{informative intention}, which is their intending for the receiver to believe something. The sender's \emph{communicative intention} is then their intending for the receiver to believe that they have an informative intention. The sender may then express or convey this communicative intention to their receiver with an \emph{ostensive} behavior. If their receiver receives their communicative intention, then ostensive-inferential communication has occurred.\todo{Add example}

Currently, there is no evidence that any species other than humans communicate ostensively \citep{Scott-Phillips18-communication}. As a result, not only may one distinguish between the code model and the ostensive-inferential model to define what communication entails, one may also conceptualize these two models as capturing two different types of communication. The code model then captures the way that non-human animals communicate, and the ostensive-inferential model then captures the way that humans communicate with each other.

Finally, I would like to note that Mercier nor Sperber ever defines what they take as the definition of communication. I will assume that they adhere to the ostensive-inferential conception of communication, since this theory was co-introduced by Sperber \citep{SperberWilson86} and in their writings, Mercier and Sperber often refer to the principles of relevance theory \citep{MS09, MS11, Sperber10}.

% It is this ostensive-inferential model that I will consider to form the definition of \emph{human communication} throughout this thesis. When I speak of communication broadly construed, I will adhere to the definition of communication by \citet{Freeberg19}. This definition is compatible with the code model outlined by \citet{Scott-Phillips18-communication};
% \largeTodo{This is a weird comment, because it implicates maybe that the ostensive-inferential model is not compatible with the Freeberg definition. Make this implicature explicit, say something about how the Freeberg definition compares to the two models we have.}
% the code model, however, provides a level of detail that will not be necessary for our discussions of non-human animal communication.
% \largeTodo{Explicate the relation between the two models/definitions, because now it's very unclear why and how I'm using two different definitions at the same time}

\section{Communication in non-human animals}
\label{sec:comm:phylogeny}

Now we turn to the evolutionary question: what is the evolutionary history of communication, and more specifically, how can the trajectory from primate communication to human communication be explained?

As already mentioned, one fundamental difference between the communication of non-human animals and humans is by which model their communication is best described: the code model and the ostensive-inferential model, respectively \citep{Scott-Phillips15-primate, Scott-Phillips18-communication}.
\todo{Reformulate}

Communication is used by non-human animals for a wide range of purposes, and it can be elicited by a number of stimuli. Moreover, communicative behaviors can manifest themselves in different modalities: not only can animals communicate through vocalizations, they may also communicate through gestures or glances.
\todo{Add example}

One can broadly distinguish between communication in aggressive and cooperative interactions \citep{SeyfarthCheney03}. In aggressive interactions, primates may for example use communication in order to intimidate, by signalling their size and willingness to fight. This minimizes the chances of a physical altercation or fight actually happening, which minimizes the chance of injury for both the dominant and the subordinate animal.
In cooperative interactions on the other hand, where the interests of the signaler and the receiver overlap, communication can be used to alert others about predators, to coordinate foraging activities and to facilitate social interactions:
\begin{quoting}
    {[information acquired by listeners]} may include, but is not limited to, information about predators or the urgency of a predatorâ€™s approach, group movements, intergroup interactions, or the identities of individuals involved in social events
    \hfill \citep[p.~168]{SeyfarthCheney03}
\end{quoting}

In animals in general, vocalizations are most often elicited not by just one stimulus, but rather a complex combination of them. Moreover, the "history of interactions between the individuals involved" \citep[p.~151]{SeyfarthCheney03} can also play a role in eliciting vocalizations. As for the 'immediate' stimuli eliciting vocalizations, we may distinguish between sensory stimuli on the one hand and mental stimuli on the other. Sensory stimuli then refer to stimuli received through the external senses, such as visual, auditory and olfactory senses.
\todo{Replace example}
For example, if I stop petting my dog (sensory stimulus), she will direct her gaze at me (communicative behavior) to indicate that she would like me to continue.
Mental stimuli on the other hand can be viewed as the mental states an animal attributes to another animal.
\todo{Address ToM controversy}
For example, \todo{Add example}.
This type of stimulus elicits the majority of vocalizations in human conversation, but there is no evidence that the attribution of mental states to others causes vocalizations in other animals, except for possibly chimpanzees \citep{SeyfarthCheney03}.

\citet{Tomasello09} notes that in the case of pointing gestures, humans use these mainly to be informative (i.e.\@ cooperative), whereas primates use this gesture mainly or perhaps even exclusively for imperative motives. Experimentally, Tomasello and colleagues found that primates only used a pointing gesture when they benefited from this act of communication, while 25-month-old infants pointed regardless of whether they themself benefited from this action \citep{Bullinger11}. As \citet{Tomasello09} concludes, "[the infants] could not help but be informative" (p.~17). Speaking of which, let us now consider communication in human infants.

As we will discuss deception in communication a great deal (for example in \cref{sec:deception}), let us briefly touch on deception in animals as well. As noted by \citet{Dor17} in his discussion of deception, primates possess the ability to deceive others.
However, compared to humans, their ability to deceive is rather primitive. Dor argues that this is due to the fact that language uniquely enables humans to communicate with each others' imaginations. This opens up countless avenues for deception by the fabrication of stories. For primates on the other hand, without language, it is difficult to fabricate stories to deceive others. They can hide information: for example, they might suppress the food call they would usually expel upon finding food in order to keep this food for themself. However, their ability to fabricate information is very limited.

\section{Communication in children's development}
\label{sec:comm:ontogeny}

Now that we have seen how communication works in non-human animals, let us turn to how children start communicating throughout their development.
Around their first birthdays, children start communicating ostensively by pointing \citep{Tomasello08}.
Although at first glance pointing may seem like a simple behavior, it may be used in a number of communicative contexts to convey a fairly wide range of messages and intentions.
For example, infants may point at a cup to indicate that they want to drink from it (i.e., pointing to request), but they may also point to a hidden object that their parent is searching for (i.e. pointing to inform).
% \largeTodo{Why do we focus on pointing? Elaborate more on why pointing constitutes communication, and other earlier stuff doesnâ€™t. For example, raising arms to parent: a behavior that we inherited from our ape ancestors (instinct to climb on parent). Is that communication? What distinguishes these earlier from the later interactions? And consider for example the communicative function of crying, is this mentioned by Tomasello or by other authors? How is that different from vocalizations in animals? Simple stimulus-response? This basically all comes down/back to the definition of communication I adhere to, and intentionality in it.}

On the classic account, pointing can serve either of two communicative motives: an imperative motive, in which the pointer requests things from someone, and a declarative motive, in which the pointer shares their experiences and emotions with someone.
This account can be extended upon by distinguishing between declaratives as expressives (sharing attitudes and emotions) and declaratives as informatives (providing information), and by furthermore conceiving of imperatives as a continuum, with the underlying motive ranging on a scale from individualistic -- e.g. forcing someone to do something -- to cooperative, e.g. indirectly making a request to someone by informing them of some desire \citep{Tomasello08}.

The fact that pointing is a fairly complex communicative act is underscored by the fact that non-human animals are not able to understand pointing in the same way humans are. \todo{Add reference}
The hypothesis is that in order to communicate intentionally,
like children begin doing around their first birthday, first the skills and motivations for \emph{shared intentionality} need to be present in the infant; that without skills of shared intentionality, infants could only communicate intentionally, but not cooperatively.
Shared intentionality is the "ability to participate with others in interactions involving joint goals, intentions, and attention" \citep[p.~139]{Tomasello08}. Communicative pointing behaviors in infants emerge around the same time as skills and motivations of shared intentionality do, which according to Tomasello confirms this hypothesis of dependency between them.

Tomasello further investigates what he calls \emph{pantomiming} or \emph{iconic gestures}, which are symbolic or representational gestures. \todo{Add example}
He presents empirical evidence\todo{Add evidence} that these kinds of gestures rely heavily on convention for their meaning, and that the acquisition and usage of these conventions bears a strong resemblance to the acquisition and usage of language.

In short, infants first acquire the skills and motivations needed for shared intentionality; then they acquire the skills and motivations for communicative pointing; and then they acquire the ability to use iconic gestures and language around the same time.

Let us, like in \cref{sec:comm:phylogeny}, touch briefly upon deception in ontogeny. Children acquire the skills for lying around the age of four \citep{Lee13}.
