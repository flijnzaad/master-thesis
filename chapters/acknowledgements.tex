\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

during thesis i've learned a lot about myself, about doing research, etc. although this thesis probably marks my departure from academia, i know that i've picked up skills that will come in handy for the rest of my life.

Thanks goes out to:

Karolina
- enthusiasm
- inspiring discussions, literature recommendations that i hope to get to after the mol
- guidance
- freedom
- felt like academic equals in our discussions. my opinions and analyses were always valued
- patience and flexibility

all the ILLC staff that inspired me in the courses and led me to this thesis

MoL friends: list them all! vacation people, jasper, max, nik
- i'm the last to graduate, so you guys don't have a lot to do with my thesis
- but you made my time at the mol special
- (maybe too vulnerable? but:) i was a less active member of the group because of my busy life in utrecht, but have always felt just as much part of the group as any other member, and that's really special.
- especially fond of the weekly dinners at the prinses beatrixlaan
- loved our annual vacations, especially the hiking trip
- hope it stays a tradition

other family and friends; especially how conversations about my thesis forced me to explain the story to leken, which really helped in shaping the story.

all of my Focusmate virtual coworking buddies all over the world, without whom this would have not been possible. made spending days on end at my desk fun

Ronneke
- endless love and moral support, especially in the last weeks
- academic support, as a seasoned humanities student. help with planning and tips on how to do research
