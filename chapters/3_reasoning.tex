\chapter{Why do we reason?}
\label{ch:reasoning}

Reason is considered by many to be that which sets human animals apart from their non-human fellow animals. In this chapter, we will consider reasoning from the different angles laid out in \cref{sec:evo-conclusion} --- in particular in relation to the theory under scrutiny, Mercier \& Sperber's argumentative theory of reasoning. First, we consider Mercier \& Sperber's definition of reasoning and compare it with some other definitions of reasoning. Then, we will look at reasoning in developing children and in non-human animals. Finally, we will consider the utility of reasoning, and expound the argumentative theory of reasoning.

\section{What is reasoning?}
\label{sec:reasoning-def}

Before anything else can be said about reasoning, it is critical to get clear what we mean exactly when we talk about reasoning. \citet{MS11} take the following as their definition of reasoning:

\begin{quoting}
    \emph{Reasoning}, as commonly understood, refers to a very special form of inference at the conceptual level, where not only is a new mental representation (or \emph{conclusion}) consciously produced, but the previously held representations (or \emph{premises}) that warrant it are also consciously entertained.
    \hfill (p.~57)
\end{quoting}
In other words, that what distinguishes reasoning from inference is the conscious attending to the representations.
In their definition of reasoning, Mercier \& Sperber take \emph{inference} to be "the production of new mental representations on the basis of previously held representations" (ibid.). They make explicit that this definition of reasoning excludes non-human animals and preverbal children from the realm of reasoners.
We will return to the role of the position of their definition of reasoning within the argumentative theory of reasoning in \cref{sec:def-scrutiny}.

Mercier \& Sperber state that their definition of reasoning is the one that is most commonly adhered to in the psychology of reasoning. However plausible, this claim is difficult to verify since most work in psychology of reasoning does not explicitly define reasoning within the frame of their research. Especially when one moves from psychology of reasoning to the neighboring discipline of animal cognition, what is understood by 'reasoning' becomes fuzzy. As an example, \citet{Andrews15} and \citet{Call06} discuss animal reasoning at length, yet they never explicate the definition of reasoning they adhere to.

\subsection{Other definitions of reasoning}
Let us now mention and compare two other definitions of reasoning, one due to cognitive scientist Vinod Goel and another due to philosopher Gilbert Harman.

\subsubsection{Goel}
In his \citeyear{Goel22} book "Reason and Less", Goel proposes and develops an account of \emph{tethered rationality}, where four different cognitive systems work in tandem to determine human behavior. The four systems, from evolutionarily 'oldest' to 'youngest', are the autonomic, instinctual, associative, and reasoning systems. These systems evolved 'on top of' each other, and are tightly integrated with one another --- tethered, as Goel calls it.
Goel then describes (and in doing so more or less defines) reasoning as follows:
\begin{quoting}
    Reasoning is a system for generating new beliefs from observations and/or existing beliefs and maintaining consistency of our beliefs (i.e., mental representations of the world).
    \hfill (p.~114)
\end{quoting}
In other words, according to Goel reasoning has a dual role: it generates inferences (in the way Mercier \& Sperber define them), and it ensures that our beliefs remain internally consistent or coherent.

\section{The utility of reasoning}
\label{sec:reason-function}

Let us now look at the utility of reasoning, and in particular, dive head-first into the argumentative theory of reasoning.
We briefly consider classical accounts of the utility of reasoning, and then we will consider Mercier \& Sperber's account at length.

\subsubsection{Classical and dual-process theories of reasoning}

Classical theories of reasoning, building on centuries of philosophical work, maintain that the function of reasoning is to enhance or support individual cognition \citep{MS11}.

\begin{quoting}
    one of the functions of System 2 is to monitor the quality of both mental operations and overt behavior
    \hfill \citep[p.~699]{Kahneman03}
\end{quoting}

\begin{quoting}
    The analytic system is primarily a control system focused on the interests of the whole person. It is the primary maximizer of an individual's \emph{personal} goal satisfaction.
    (p.~64)
\end{quoting}

\citet{Goel22} also more or less adheres to this classical account of what the function of reasoning is, stating that
\begin{quoting}
    the function of the reasoning mind is to allow for greater flexibility in individual behavior, and thus more finely tuned responses to environmental stimuli than can be accommodated by the autonomic, instinctive, and associative minds.
    \hfill (p.~114)
\end{quoting}

\subsection{Introductory thoughts on reasoning by Mercier \& Sperber}

\subsection{Mercier \& Sperber's dual-process theory}

\subsection{Mercier \& Sperber's argumentative theory of reasoning}
\label{sec:exp-atr}

The argumentative theory of reasoning is Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber's influential, but not uncontroversial, account of the function of reasoning from an evolutionary perspective. They introduced and coined the theory in a \citeyear{MS11} paper, a culmination of more than a decade's worth of experimental and philosophical research \citep{Sperber01, Sperber10, MS09, Sperber00}.
Briefly, the argumentative theory of reasoning states that the main function of reasoning is to produce arguments and evaluate arguments of others, in order to stabilize communication.
Before we can tackle the theory in detail, it is useful to look at some of Mercier \& Sperber's foundations to the theory first. We already discussed their views on the evolution of communication in \cref{sec:comm-ATR}, so now we turn to their views on reasoning. We first discuss some points about reasoning they offer in \citet{Sperber01,Sperber10}, then we will discuss a dual-process theory of reasoning proposed by \citet{MS09}, and finally we will go through the \citeyear{MS11} that coined the argumentative theory of reasoning.
